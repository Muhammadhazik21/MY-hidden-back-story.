    <font size="36">My Free fire journey:-</font>
      <text position="center">
    <h2>It all started around 9 years ago. At that time, my favorite game was PUBG. I was young, full of energy, and excited every time I logged in. I loved the sound of footsteps in Pochinki, the thrill of hiding in houses, and the rush of getting “Winner Winner Chicken Dinner.” Every match felt like a battle of survival.</h2>
    <h2>But slowly, after just 1.5 years, something began to change. The same maps, the same fights, and the same routines started to feel boring. The excitement that once kept me awake at night had disappeared. I still played sometimes, but the spark was gone.</h2>
    <h2>One day, while scrolling through the Play Store, looking for something fresh, I saw a game called “Garena Free Fire.” At first, I laughed. The name sounded strange compared to PUBG. But out of curiosity, I pressed the download button.</h2>
    <h2>When I opened the game for the first time, I was disappointed. The graphics looked cheap, unrealistic, and almost like a cartoon. “What is this?” I thought. I played a few matches but didn’t enjoy it. The graphics were the reason I quit immediately.</h2>
    <h2>But time has a funny way of changing things. After a month or two, I heard from people that Free Fire’s graphics had improved. Out of curiosity, I gave it another chance. And that one decision completely changed my gaming journey.</h2>
    <h2>This time, when I dropped onto Bermuda, I felt something different. The game was fast-paced, exciting, and fun. Matches were shorter, the weapons felt unique, and the maps had their own charm. Soon, Free Fire started to grow on me.</h2>
    <h2>Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. I wasn’t just playing a game anymore – I was building memories. I made new friends from different cities, bonded over voice chats, laughed when we lost, and celebrated every Booyah. Free Fire wasn’t just a game; it became a world where I belonged.</h2>
    <h2>Then came the bundles. Everyone wanted them, and so did I. When I finally got the legendary Sakura Bundle and the Hip Hop Bundle, it felt like owning a piece of Free Fire’s history. They weren’t just skins – they were trophies, symbols of my dedication. I remember the excitement every time a new event arrived, waiting for the spins, praying for luck.</h2>
    <h1>Everything felt perfect. But as time passed, the Free Fire I loved slowly began to change.</h1>
    <h2>In 2023, the first heartbreak came. Old Factory was removed from the map. That building wasn’t just a location – it was a memory. The place where I had countless fights, climbed on the roof with my squad, and practiced gloo wall tricks. Losing it felt like losing a piece of myself. Still, I didn’t quit. I told myself, “It’s just one update. The game is still alive.”</h2>
    <h2>But then came 2024. And with it, another painful update. This time, Old Peak was gone. The heart of Bermuda, the place where intense battles happened, the spot that defined Free Fire’s rush – erased from the game. To make it worse, the Glider was removed too. One by one, all the things that made Free Fire special disappeared.</h2>
    <h2>Free Fire was no longer the game I fell in love with. The nostalgia was gone. The places that held my memories were replaced with things I didn’t recognize.</h2>
    <h1>So finally, just 1–2 months ago, I made the hardest decision: I quit Free Fire.</h1>
    <h2>It wasn’t easy. Uninstalling the game felt like closing a chapter of my life. But I realized something – the real treasure wasn’t in the graphics, or the bundles, or even the game itself.</h2>
    <h2>The real treasure was in the memories:-</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
      <h2>The late-night matches with friends.</h2></li>
     <li>  <h2> The endless laughter in voice chat.</h2></li>
      <li> <h2> The excitement of winning rare bundles.</h2></li>
      <li> <h2> The thrill of dropping into Old Factory and Old Peak.</h2>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Those memories will never fade, even if the game changes forever.</h2>
    <h2>Free Fire may no longer be installed on my phone, but it will always remain installed in my heart.</h2>
