      <text position="center">
   <h2>When I was a kid, everyone used to ask me the same question: “What do you want to become when you grow up?” And like many others, my answer was simple — “I want to become a doctor.”</h2>
   <h2>Back then, the idea of being a doctor felt noble and powerful. Saving lives, wearing a white coat, and being respected by everyone — it sounded like the perfect dream. For years, I held on to that ambition, imagining myself with a stethoscope around my neck, helping patients in a big hospital.</h2> 
   <h2>But everything began to change when I reached class 8–9.</h2>
   <h2>At that time, I was introduced to the world of computers in a way I had never seen before. Until then, computers were just for games, movies, or typing school projects. But suddenly, I discovered that computers could do something far more magical — they could follow commands, they could think, they could solve problems.</h2>
   <h2>The first time I saw a simple program run — maybe just printing “Hello World” on the screen — I felt something click inside me. It wasn’t just text on a screen. It was like a door opening into another universe.</h2>
   <h2>Slowly, my interest shifted. While others in my class still dreamed of becoming doctors, engineers, or teachers, I found myself drawn deeper into the world of programming.</h2>
   <h2>At first, it was confusing. I remember staring at the code, not knowing why there were so many symbols, semicolons, brackets, and capital letters. Sometimes even a single missing semicolon could break the whole program. I used to feel frustrated, but every time I solved the error, the happiness was unmatched.</h2>
   <h2>This struggle gave me something that my “doctor dream” never did — a sense of adventure. Coding was like solving puzzles, unlocking mysteries step by step. Each bug I fixed felt like a small victory, and each program I completed felt like creating something from nothing.</h2>
   <h2>I started imagining myself not in a hospital, but in front of a computer screen, writing lines of code that could change lives in a different way. I realized that while doctors save lives with medicine, programmers change lives with technology. And maybe, in this modern world, technology was just another form of healing.</h2>
   <h2>Day by day, my passion grew. I started exploring languages like Java, Javascript, Python. Each one was like learning a new language of the future, and every “if-else” statement, every “loop,” every “class and object” gave me a strange kind of joy.</h2> 
   <h2>When my classmates talked about biology, I listened. But my heart wasn’t in it anymore. While they memorized the human body, I was busy memorizing syntax. While they dreamed of surgeries, I dreamed of building apps, websites, and maybe even AI systems that could make the future brighter.</h2>
   <h2>By the time I finished class 9, my dream had completely changed. The white coat of a doctor no longer tempted me. Instead, the glow of a computer screen, the power of writing my own code, and the thrill of becoming a programmer had taken over my heart.</h2>
   <h2>And I knew, deep inside, that this wasn’t just a phase. This was my new identity.</h2>
   <h2>I wasn’t going to save lives with injections or medicines anymore. I was going to build a future with logic and code.</h2>
