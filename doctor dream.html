    <font size="36">My dream of successfull doctor:-</font>
      <text position="center">
    <p>
      <h3>  When I was a child, I often imagined myself as a doctor. I would picture myself wearing a white coat, holding a stethoscope, and helping patients who were in pain. The idea of saving lives and being someone who could bring hope to families filled me with pride and determination. I admired doctors for their dedication and the respect they earned in society, and for many years, I believed that this was my only goal in life. Whenever someone asked me what I wanted to become when I grew up, I confidently answered, “A doctor.” My family and teachers also encouraged me, telling me that medicine was a noble profession and that I had the ability to achieve it. </h3>

      <h3>  However, life does not always go exactly as we plan. As I grew older and advanced in my studies, my journey began to change in unexpected ways. In school, I loved biology and enjoyed learning about the human body, but at the same time, I found myself deeply interested in physics, mathematics, and technology. During classes, I realized that I was not only fascinated by how the body works but also by how machines operate, how computers solve problems, and how inventions shape our modern world. Slowly, I started questioning my childhood dream. Was becoming a doctor truly the only path for me, or was I discovering a new calling?</h3>
    </p>

     <h3>   The turning point came during my later school years when I was introduced to engineering concepts and programming. I remember working on simple projects in physics class, building circuits, and solving mathematical problems. That excitement felt different. I no longer only dreamed about hospitals and patients; I began to imagine myself creating solutions, designing systems, and using technology to help people in another way. My interest grew stronger when I learned how engineers develop innovations that impact millions of lives — from medical equipment used in hospitals to software that connects people across the world.</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>  At first, I felt confused and even guilty because for so many years I had been telling everyone that I wanted to become a doctor. But gradually I realized that choosing engineering did not mean giving up on helping others. It only meant that I would be helping society in a different way. Doctors save lives through medicine, but engineers improve lives through ideas, designs, and inventions. Both professions are important, and both contribute to humanity.</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>  So, although I once dreamed of being a doctor, I eventually accepted my passion for engineering. Today, as I continue on the path to becoming an engineer, I feel proud of the journey I have taken. It reminds me that life is not always about following one fixed plan; sometimes it is about discovering new opportunities and listening to where your true interests lie. I may not wear a white coat, but I carry the same desire to serve society — this time not through medicine, but through technology and innovation. And in the end, that makes me just as fulfilled.</h3>

      <h3>  But during 8,9 class I will changed my plain because when i see computer programers i will very shocked because he is writting a long codes in many languages like java,HTML,CSS,Python etc. Then i decided now my dream is successfull programer.Many people is talking about age. But age does not matter matter your skills in computers. why I am talking about you? Because to make your future my future is now best because i have done 3 Languages HTML,CSS,JAVA. I will motivating you to make your future.</h3>
